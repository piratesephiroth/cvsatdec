# cvsatdec
Decompresses the graphic data of the playable characters in Symphony of the Night for the Sega Saturn.

Works with ALUCARD.CHR, RICHTER.CHR, RICHTER2.CHR and MARIA.CHR. Their respective PRG files are required as well.

Decompressed files will be stored in a `<filename>_decompressed` folder next to the CHR file.

**Note**: it doesn't generate image files. You need something like TiledGGD to visualize the decompressed data.
